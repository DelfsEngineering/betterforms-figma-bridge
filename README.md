# BetterForms Figma Bridge

A Figma plugin that converts Figma designs into BetterForms page schemas, enabling seamless translation of UI designs into functional forms.

## üéØ What It Does

This plugin bridges Figma designs with FileMaker BetterForms, enabling automated conversion of UI designs into functional forms.

**How it works:**
1. Select frames, groups, or components in Figma
2. The plugin captures normalized design data (layout, styles, structure)
3. Send the data to BetterForms with one click
4. BetterForms processes the design and converts it into a working form schema

**Features:**
- Real-time selection preview with thumbnails
- Normalized JSON data structure
- Automatic updates as you change selections
- Secure API key storage
- Direct integration with BetterForms conversion pipeline

**Current Status:** MVP/PoC - Captures design data and sends to BetterForms for conversion.

## üìã Prerequisites

Before installing this plugin, ensure you have:

- **Figma Desktop App** (recommended) or Figma in a supported browser
- **Node.js** (v16 or later) and **npm** installed on your machine
- A Figma account

## üöÄ Installation Instructions

Since this plugin is not yet published to the Figma Community, you'll need to install it manually as a development plugin.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DelfsEngineering/betterforms-figma-bridge.git
cd betterforms-figma-bridge
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Step 3: Build the Plugin

```bash
npm run build
```

This compiles the TypeScript source code (`src/code.ts`) into JavaScript (`dist/code.js`) that Figma can execute.

> **Note:** During development, you can use `npm run watch` to automatically rebuild when you make changes to the source code.

### Step 4: Load the Plugin in Figma

1. **Open Figma Desktop App** (or Figma in browser)

2. **Open any Figma file** or create a new one

3. **Open the Plugins menu:**
   - Click on the menu icon (‚ò∞) in the top-left
   - Navigate to: `Plugins` ‚Üí `Development` ‚Üí `Import plugin from manifest...`

4. **Select the manifest file:**
   - Browse to the cloned repository folder: `betterforms-figma-bridge/`
   - Select the `manifest.json` file
   - Click **Open**

5. **Success!** The plugin "BetterForms Figma Bridge" is now available in your development plugins.

## üéÆ How to Use

### Running the Plugin

1. In Figma, go to: `Plugins` ‚Üí `Development` ‚Üí `BetterForms Figma Bridge`
2. The plugin panel will open with three tabs: **Preview**, **JSON**, and **Account**

### Setting Up Your API Key (First Time)

1. Click the **Account** tab
2. Get your API key from BetterForms:
   - Open the FileMaker BetterForms Editor
   - Go to **Account / Users** tab
   - Copy your API key
3. Paste the API key into the plugin
4. Click **Save**

Your API key is stored securely in Figma's client storage.

### Converting Designs to BetterForms

1. **Select a frame, group, or component** in your Figma canvas
2. The plugin automatically captures and displays your selection:
   - **Preview tab**: Shows a thumbnail image of your selection
   - **JSON tab**: Shows the complete normalized JSON data structure
3. Review the selection metadata displayed (node count, name, type)
4. Click **Send to BetterForms** to push the design data to BetterForms
5. BetterForms processes the data and completes the conversion into a working form schema

The plugin automatically updates the preview and data whenever you change your selection, making it easy to iterate on your design before sending.

### What Gets Sent to BetterForms

The plugin captures and sends a normalized, compact representation of your selection:
- **Node IDs and names**: Original Figma layer names are preserved
- **Node types**: FRAME, GROUP, TEXT, and other element types
- **Layout information**: AutoLayout properties, dimensions, positioning, padding, gaps
- **Styles**: Fills, strokes, effects, corner radius, text styles
- **Hierarchical structure**: Complete child tree (depth-limited to 6 levels, max 200 children per node)
- **Colors**: Normalized to hex format for consistency
- **Preview image**: Thumbnail PNG (base64-encoded) of the first selected node

This structured data is then processed by BetterForms' conversion engine to generate the corresponding form schema.

## üîß Development Workflow

### Building

```bash
# One-time build
npm run build

# Watch mode (auto-rebuild on changes)
npm run watch
```

### Reloading After Changes

After making code changes and rebuilding:

1. In Figma, right-click on the canvas
2. Select: `Plugins` ‚Üí `Development` ‚Üí `Reload plugin from manifest`
3. Or close and reopen the plugin
